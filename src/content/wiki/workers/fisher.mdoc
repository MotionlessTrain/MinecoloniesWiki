{% worker_infobox %}
The {% worker /%} is an important worker for your colony. As long as you provide the {% worker /%} with a fishing rod, the {% worker /%} will provide your colony with everything that can be caught: cod, salmon, pufferfish, tropical fish, junk, and sometimes even treasure like prismarine and sponges!

The higher a {% worker /%} its Focus and Agility levels, the less time it'll take before they catch something.

**Note:** The {% worker /%} will require a body of water a minimum of {% meta key="fisher_pond_size" /%} for them to be able to work, and it must be near their hut.
